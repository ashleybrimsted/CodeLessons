                    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains

                    as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only and
                    allows you to build responsive, mobile-first projects fast. This course will show you the ins and outs of Bootstrap and
                    even includes source code and a step-by-step guide to build five complete websites.</p>
