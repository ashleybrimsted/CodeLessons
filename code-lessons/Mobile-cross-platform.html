                    <p>React Native was designed by Facebook to address this problem head on. React Native acts as a bridge between the
                    JavaScript syntax and the host platform, resulting in apps that are written in JavaScript but have the look and feel of
                    a real native app. In this course, you’ll learn how to use React Native for your own development purposes.</p>

                    <p>There are three main ways an app can make money: Costing money to download, advertisement revenue, and in-app purchases (IAPs). Most apps these days utilize IAPs because they allow the app to be offered for free, (which has been shown to increase downloads) and new IAPs can continually be added with updates to the app. It’s projected that half of mobile revenue from apps in 2017 will be from IAPs, which means knowing how to incorporate them into your development can be very financially rewarding. In this course, you’ll learn how to do just that.</p>
